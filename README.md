# DefinitionOfDone

This plugin adds a checklist to the taskview, similarly to subtasks.  
Each entry consists of a title-, a description- and a togglable "done"-field.

It also supports a separator to visually structure the list. (use `=====` as description)

supports [MarkdownPlus](https://github.com/creecros/MarkdownPlus)

The whole list can be exported to json and get imported from it. Imports overwrite existing lists.

To delete an entry, you have to select it first by activating the checkbox in the options column.  
This two-step inline approach prevents accidental deletion while keeping overhead to delete multiple entries on a minimum.
